This program automatically changes the oof sound in the Roblox Player to any sound you want. Simply change the ouch.ogg file to your own file with the same name and extension.

1. Delete the ouch.ogg file 
(This is was for testing, and demo)
2. Add a new ouch.ogg file to your choosing, make sure the name is ouch.ogg 
(this is the audio file you want to use, it has to be an ogg file. You can convert an mp3 or whatever you have to an ogg file through online converters. Try this: https://online-audio-converter.com/)
3. Run the batch file.
(If it has any errors about file deletion, it'll still work and add the new ouch.ogg file)

And you're done!

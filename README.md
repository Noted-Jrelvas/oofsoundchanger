This program automatically changes the oof sound in the Roblox Player to any sound you want. Feel free to change the old original oof sound in this project to your own file with the same name and extension.

1. If you want a custom file, delete the ouch.ogg file (this is the old oof sound, feel free to keep it!)
- 1b. Add a new ouch.ogg file to your choosing, make sure the name is ouch.ogg (this is the audio file you want to use, it has to be an ogg file. You can convert an mp3 or whatever you have to an ogg file through online converters. Try this: https://online-audio-converter.com/)
2. Run the batch/sh file.
- 2b. If the shell denies to execute the sh file, run `chmod u+x ./changeoofsound.sh` and execute again
- 2c. If either the batch/sh files have any errors about file deletion, it'll still work and add the new ouch.ogg file

And you're done!
